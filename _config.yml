This exercise highlights data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization techniques (e.g., using a histogram, scatterplot, KDE plot) as well as statistical and predictive analysis including ANOVA, ML with Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial model, and model evaluation (R-squared, aka. coefficient of determination).
